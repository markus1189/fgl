5.5.0.1
-------

* Fix up Eq instances for Tree and PatriciaTree so that they work with
  multiple edges.

5.5.0.0
-------

* Add proper Show, Read and Eq instances to Data.Graph.Inductive.Tree
  and Data.Graph.Inductive.PatriciaTree.

* Add pretty-printing functions to Data.Graph.Inductive.Graph.  These
  are based upon the old Show implementation for
  Data.Graph.Inductive.Tree.

* Now use PatriciaTree by default rather than Tree (and recommend as
  such).  IntMap has been receiving a lot of optimisation work on it,
  whereas the internal FiniteMap implementation hasn't received any
  attention.

* The `version :: IO ()` action now uses the actual Cabal version.

* Remove Data.Graph.Inductive.Graphviz; use the graphviz package
  instead.

5.4.2.4
-------

* Update to work with GHC-7.2 and Cabal-1.6.

5.4.2.3
-------

* Maintainership taken over by Ivan Miljenovic.

* Allow Data.Graph.Inductive.PatriciaTree to deal with multiple edges
  between nodes.
